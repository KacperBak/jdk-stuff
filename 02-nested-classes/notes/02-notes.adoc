Java allows you to define a class within another class.
....
class OuterClass {
    ...
    class NestedClass {
        ...
    }
}
....
There a two types of member classes `inner classes` and `static nested classes`
....
class OuterClass {
    ...
    static class StaticNestedClass {
        ...
    }
    class InnerClass {
        ...
    }
}
....

* A nested class is a member of its enclosing class.
* A member class can be declared private, public, protected, or package private.

WARNING: If a member class is declared **public** or **protected**, the class is being exported as an API. Any change from `inner` to `static nested` class would break binary compatibility!

There are `local classes`
....

....
There are `anonymous classes`

== Inner class

* An inner class has access to other members of the enclosing class, even **private** members.
* An inner class cannot define any static members itself, except **constants**.
* An inner class is **associated with/tied to** an instance of its enclosing class, e.g. `InnerClass` can exist only within an instance of `OuterClass`.
* This association or superfluous reference costs extra space and time, because both objects are not eligible for garbage collection.
* Use this class **ONLY** if you have to access nonstatic members of the enclosing class!

.Create an instance of an inner class
....
//First OuterClass has to be created!
OuterClass outerObject = new OuterClass();

//Then InnerClass can be created.
OuterClass.InnerClass innerObject = outerObject.new InnerClass();
....

== Static nested class
* A **static** nested class cannot refer directly to **instance** variables or methods defined in its enclosing class.
* A **static** nested class can only access **static** members of it's enclosing class.
* A **static** nested class can be instantiated!

.Create an instance of a static nested class
....
OuterClass.StaticNestedClass nestedObject = new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();
....


== When to use what?
=== Nested classes
* If a class is useful to only one other class, then it is logical to embed it in that class and keep the two together.
* To increases encapsulation: Consider two top-level classes, A and B, where B needs access to members of A that would otherwise be declared private.
By hiding class B within class A, A's members can be declared private and B can access them. In addition, B itself should be hidden from the outside world, with a `private` constructor.

NOTE: A nested class should **ONLY** serve its enclosing class! If a nested class would be useful in some other context, then it should be a **top-level** class!

=== Inner class
* If you declare a nested class that **does** require access to an enclosing instance, declare an inner class.

=== Static nested class
* If you declare a nested class that **does not** require access to an enclosing instance, always put the `static` modifier in its declaration.


== Shadowing
* If a declaration of a type of the inner scope has the same name as another declaration in the outer scope, then the declaration shadows the declaration of the outer scope.
* You cannot refer to a shadowed declaration by its name alone.

NOTE: Inner scope shadows outer scope

....
public class ShadowTest {

    public int x = 0;

    class FirstLevel {

        public int x = 1;

        void methodInFirstLevel(int x) {

            //x = 23
            System.out.println("x = " + x);

            //this.x = 1
            System.out.println("this.x = " + this.x);

            //ShadowTest.this.x = 0
            System.out.println("ShadowTest.this.x = " + ShadowTest.this.x);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String... args) {
        ShadowTest st = new ShadowTest();
        ShadowTest.FirstLevel fl = st.new FirstLevel();
        fl.methodInFirstLevel(23);
    }
}
....

== Serialization
* Serialization of inner classes, including local and anonymous classes, is strongly discouraged.
* Possible compatibility issues can  occur if you serialize an inner class and then deserialize it with a different JRE implementation.
